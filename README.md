# Getting Started with Youtube App

## Project configurations

### Create typescript based project

> npx create-react-app youtube --template typescript

### Test cases

- The inbuild test script will runs all the test files that are kept inside the `src`

  > npm test

- If we want to put all the test files outside of src then we have to configure `jest` in the project
